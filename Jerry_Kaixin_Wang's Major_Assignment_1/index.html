                        <p>The Audi RS7 is the less sensible sibling of the RS6 Avant.

The 2020 Audi RS7 Sportback is a wide-bodied, heart-pounding four-door sports car that features a usable back seat and practical hatchback. The RS model wears more aggressive-looking bodywork and has exclusive high-performance equipment that helps it compete with raucous rivals.</p>
